    <h3 class="align">In this project, my group and I used Python Turtle Graphics to make a house on a hill. We used functions such as "turtle.goto", "turtle.fill", etc. We also made a sun which rotates through the sky, the sky changes color with it. We used while loops to make the tree and used only turtle functions to make this entire project.</h3>
    
    <h3 class="align">Second Project</h3>

    <h3 class="align">For our second project, we made a bidding game in which you bid on horses. The horses in this case are shaped as turtles and race from the starting point, to the finish line. The winning horse is different each time and is randomized after each round. Before bidding on the horses, you input your name, which horse to bid on, and how much you would like to bid. Then the horses will race. After the race is finished, you will be given the results and how much money you either lost or gained.

      <h3 class="align">For this project we created a pirate adventure game. There are many different routes and paths to follow and many different outcomes. Each decision you make, a picture will appear and show the current location your boat is in. This picture is followed by dialogue and a question as to where you will go next.
